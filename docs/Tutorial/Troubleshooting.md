# Troubleshooting


### XML Parsing Errors

Sometimes the XML parser will throw errors with external tilesets that have been downloaded from the internet. Importing & re-exporting the tileset should make the error go away.


### Code Signing Errors

Occasionally you'll get a code signing error when compiling on OSX:

    Command /usr/bin/codesign failed with exit code 1

If you're using Photoshop to save images, you might need to cleanup Finder metadata. To check, browse to your images directory in shell and run the following command:
 
    ls -al@

If any of your files have extra metadata that Xcode doesn't like, you'll see it listed below the file name:

![Image Metadata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfessenden/SKTiled/master/docs/Images/xattr-cleanup.png)

Running the following command will clean up the extra data:

    xattr -c *.png
